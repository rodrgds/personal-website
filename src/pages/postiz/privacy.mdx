# Privacy Policy for Postiz Self-Hosted App

**Last Updated:** July 21, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the Postiz self-hosted application ("the App") to interact with TikTok.

### 1. Information We Collect
Because this is a self-hosted application, we do not have a central server that collects your data. The information processed by the App is stored on your own server and is handled as follows:

- **TikTok Account Information**: To function, the App requires you to grant it access to your TikTok account via the TikTok API. This includes your TikTok profile information (username, profile picture) and permissions to post content on your behalf.
- **Content**: The App processes the videos, images, and text that you schedule or upload for posting to your TikTok account.
- **Technical Data**: The App may use your TikTok API credentials and access tokens to communicate with TikTok. These are stored securely on your server.

### 2. How We Use Your Information
Your information is used for the sole purpose of operating the App as you direct it. This includes:
- Authenticating your TikTok account.
- Uploading and scheduling your content for posting to TikTok.
- Displaying your account information within the App's interface.

### 3. Data Sharing
We do not share your information with any third parties. The only data sharing that occurs is between your self-hosted App instance and TikTok's servers, as is necessary to post your content. This App will not add any promotional watermarks or logos to your content.

### 4. Data Security and Retention
You are responsible for the security of your self-hosted server. We recommend implementing standard security measures to protect your data. API keys and other credentials should be stored securely. All data is retained on your server for as long as you choose to keep it.

### 5. Your Rights (GDPR)
As a user, you have full control over your data. In line with GDPR and other privacy laws, you have the right to:
- **Access**: You can access all data processed by the App, as it is stored on your server.
- **Rectification**: You can correct or update your information at any time.
- **Erasure**: You can delete any or all of your data, or the entire application instance, from your server at any time.

### 6. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. As you are self-hosting, you will be responsible for applying any updates to the application.
