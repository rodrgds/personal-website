Over the years, I've worked with a variety of tools and languages to build software, but these are the ones I keep coming back to:

- **Games**: Unreal Engine for AAA titles; Godot for everything else
- **Web apps**: Laravel (PHP)
- **Websites**: Hugo (Go) or Astro (JavaScript)
- **APIs**: Fiber (Golang)
- **Mobile Apps**: Native (Kotlin/Swift) for platform-specific; Flutter (Dart) for cross-platform
- **CLI & embedded**: Rust
- **Scripting**: Lua
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL for most use cases; SQLite for simpler projects

**JavaScript** and **Python** are versatile but rarely the best at any one thing.

Ultimately, the best tool depends on your project and preferences.
The tools listed above are go-to, safe bets that I'd recommend to most developers when little-to-no context is provided.
